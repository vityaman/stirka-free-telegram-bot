# STIRKA_FREE Telegram Bot

## Why does it exist?
In our dormitory we have a few public 
washing machines, and we faced with the problem
that it is very inconvenient to keep track of 
time when machines are busy and when they are free,
so we can go and use it.
We created a group chat for this purpose but it
is ugly solution too.
So this telegram bot created to solve our problems
and provide us with useful functionality.

## Required python packages
- ```pip install unittest``` - for unit testing
- ```pip install python-telegram-bot``` - telegram bot api wrapper
- ```pip install python-dotenv``` - reading data from .env files
